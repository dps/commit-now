				<p>If you want to achieve something great, you need to start taking the small steps towards it now.  One of the best ways of doing this, is making a clear commitment, every day, to do something towards your goal tomorrow, and making that commitment public.  The accountability that comes with public commitments makes you more likely to achieve your stated goals. </p>
				<p>This simple web application is designed to help you achieve your goals by providing a forum in which you can publicly make a commitment to take action tomorrow in furtherance of your own goals.  You can make a commitment either anonymously or openly.  You will receive an email the next morning reminding you of your commitment and another at the end of the day, following up and asking whether you stood by your commitment. </p>

				<p>I created this web application for two reasons.  First, I think that it will be useful, not just for me, but for everyone who chooses to use it.  Second, because I wanted to learn how to make a simple web application.  The internet has changed all of our lives and has huge potential for further positive change - but it is only we that can create that change, one small step at a time.</p>
